The day after arrival they are checked in by our fantastic vet Dr Brown who does a head to toe inspection, once complete the puppies fecal is checked. The process of checking all the puppies in is completed at approximately 2 pm. The same staff the takes care of the vet check is then free to take any requested photos and videos.

        title: "Q: What happens if my puppy's FLIGHT is DELAYED?",
        content: "A: We have no control over the flight status once your puppy is tendered with the airlines. Keep in mind, we do not work for the airlines. We do everything in our power to make sure your puppy is where it should be on the day we book it. Although it's rare, we have no control over delayed flights & cancelled flights due to weather. A delayed flight does not mean your puppy is not coming! It's the same as when people fly! Sometimes the flights are late, but they still arrive. Please don't accuse Delta of stealing puppies or call us and say we're a SCAM because of a delayed flight. The puppy's health is our number one priority! The airlines will not fly puppies over certain temperatures. This is about the puppy & its health and NOT YOUR SCHEDULE or OURS!! As always, you will have the tracking number & flight number to know exactly where your puppy is once it is on the plane. It's always a good idea to check the flight status before leaving your home (as we provide the link in the Flight Info Email). For more info you can always go to www.deltacargo.com or www.aacargo.com depending on which airline is transporting your puppy."

        title: "Q: Why are the puppies different PRICES?",
        content: "A: There are many different variables used to price our puppies. Male vs Female. Breeder price. Size of puppy. Look of puppy, etc. It's a difficult formula we use when pricing a pup, but has nothing to do with HEALTH! Every one of our puppies has a certified health check from a veterinarian. Females typically are more desired, so they will usually be a higher in price."
